## PROBLEM STATEMENT
● In today’s world, women often face the dilemma of wanting to keep up with trends
and maintain a diverse wardrobe while also being mindful of their environmental
impact and budget constraints.\
● The traditional model of purchasing new items frequently leads to closet clutter,
and environmental degradation. Women with varying body types often struggle to
find clothing that fits them well and aligns with their personal style preferences.\
● Women, in particular, are often targeted by the fast fashion industry, which
encourages frequent purchases. This not only contributes to environmental issues
such as pollution and resource depletion but also perpetuates harmful labor
practices in the garment industry.\
● By providing a sustainable alternative to traditional shopping, our fashion rental
subscription service platform addresses these concerns while still allowing women
to enjoy fashionable attire.

## THE SOLUTION
● Our platform provides a Fashion Rental Subscription Service that offers sustainably made clothing
and accessories for women. Users can rent items for a fraction of the retail price, wear them for a
limited period, and return them for cleaning and reuse.\
● Our primary objective is to promote sustainable fashion practices by offering a platform where
women can access high-quality, sustainably made clothing and accessories without contributing to
the cycle of overconsumption and waste.\
● Our platform will cater to diverse body types and style preferences through features such as fit
prediction algorithms, ensuring that all women can find clothing that suits their individual needs.\
● By encouraging users to rent and return items for cleaning and reuse, the platform fosters a culture
of sharing and collaboration, reducing the overall environmental footprint of fashion and will raise
awareness about the environmental and social impact of the fashion industry, empowering women
to make informed choices and participate in the movement towards sustainable fashion.\
● By addressing these objectives, the fashion rental subscription service aims to revolutionize the
way women approach fashion consumption, promoting conscious choices that benefit both
individuals and the planet.
